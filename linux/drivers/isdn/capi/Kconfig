# Kconfig for the CAPI subsystem.

config ISDN_CAPI_MAX_DEVS
	int "Maximum number of ISDN devices"
	range 1 255
	default "4"
	depends on ISDN_CAPI
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of ISDN devices which
	  the CAPI subsystem will support.

config ISDN_CAPI_MAX_APPLS
	int "Maximum number of CAPI applications"
	range 8 65535
	default "64"
	depends on ISDN_CAPI
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CAPI applications
	  which the CAPI subsystem will support.

config ISDN_CAPI_KERNELCAPI
	tristate "CAPI2.0 kernelcapi interface (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on ISDN_CAPI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This provides the CAPI interface for kernel level applications as
	  described by the CAPI 2.0 standard, see <http://www.capi.org>.
	  However, kernel level applications are encouraged to use the new API,
	  see include/linux/isdn/capiappl.h.

config ISDN_CAPI_CAPI20
	tristate "CAPI2.0 /dev/capi20 support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on ISDN_CAPI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option will provide the CAPI 2.0 interface to userspace
	  applications via /dev/capi20.	 Applications should use the
	  standardized libcapi20 to access this functionality.	You should say
	  Y/M here.

config ISDN_CAPI_MIDDLEWARE
	bool "CAPI2.0 Middleware support"
	depends on ISDN_CAPI_CAPI20
	help
	  This option will enhance the capabilities of the /dev/capi20
	  interface.  It will provide a means of moving a data connection,
	  established via the usual /dev/capi20 interface to a special tty
	  device.  If you want to use pppd with pppdcapiplugin to dial up to
	  your ISP, say Y here.

config ISDN_CAPI_CAPIFS_BOOL
	bool "CAPI2.0 filesystem support"
	depends on ISDN_CAPI_MIDDLEWARE
	help
	  This option provides a special file system, similar to /dev/pts with
	  device nodes for the special ttys established by using the
	  middleware extension above.  If you want to use pppd with
	  pppdcapiplugin to dial up to your ISP, say Y here.

config ISDN_CAPI_CAPIFS
	tristate
	depends on ISDN_CAPI_CAPIFS_BOOL
	default ISDN_CAPI_CAPI20

config ISDN_CAPI_CAPIDRV
	tristate "CAPI2.0 capidrv interface support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on ISDN_CAPI && ISDN_I4L && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option provides the glue code to hook up CAPI driven cards to
	  the legacy isdn4linux link layer.  If you have a card which is
	  supported by a CAPI driver, but still want to use old features like
	  ippp interfaces or ttyI emulation, say Y/M here.
